# 📊 Jobs Analysis in Jadarat: Trends & Insights

## 📌 Introduction  
This project aims to explore job postings from **Jadarat**, a Saudi job portal, to uncover insights about hiring trends, salary distributions, and candidate preferences. By analyzing various attributes such as required experience, company type, job location, and gender preference, we gain a deeper understanding of employment patterns in Saudi Arabia.

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
We are interested in understanding the employment landscape within Saudi Arabia. We would like to know:

1. What proportion of job postings is attributed to each region within the kingdom?
2. Is there a gender preference indicated in the job postings?
3. What is the expected salary range for fresh graduates?
4. Are job opportunities predominantly targeted at individuals with experience, or is there room for fresh graduates as well?

## 🏆 Objectives  
1. Examine job distribution across different regions.  
2. Analyze salary ranges, particularly for fresh graduates.  
3. Identify whether job postings favor a specific gender.  
4. Assess the experience requirements in job postings.  
5. Detect salary outliers and understand market salary trends.
